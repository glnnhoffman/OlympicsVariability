# Olympic Medal Variability Analysis

## Purpose

This repository utilized olympic medal result, host nation, and participation data to determine the olympic event with the most variablity in country receiving a medal in the past ~100 years. 

Rugby, one of the highest variablity events, was then used to determine 2024 draft order for a fantasy football league. Specifically, the 12 teams participating in the 2024 Paris Women's Rugby 7s were assigned to each member of a 12-team league.

## Usage
